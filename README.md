## Folders 
Section describes the project structure of this repository.

### Scripts
Folder contains all of the scripts. 
1. `data_scraper`: to scrape the related dataset from wikipedia.  Data scraped will be sent to `./data` directory directly. Processed DataFrames will be kept in the github, however, raw scraped data is added to .gitignore. You can find the raw data on [our drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JdVMY3asgYR94n4M4ifBRCqP4cNXIyu0?usp=drive_link). (It is a large zip file!)
2. `data_processing`: scripts for data processing purposes
3. `data_analysis`: mainly `.ipynb` to visualise graphs/relationships, or to conduct statistical tests.

### Data
Import the scraped data from [our drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JdVMY3asgYR94n4M4ifBRCqP4cNXIyu0?usp=drive_link) and upload them in this folder.


### Output
Any files from the analysis will be uploaded in this folder. Upload it on [our drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JdVMY3asgYR94n4M4ifBRCqP4cNXIyu0?usp=drive_link) too.
